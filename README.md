# Poor Man's CAN Bus

Explains how to connect 2 Photons or Electrons together using CAN bus
and how to prototype using an AND gate IC before buying a real CAN
transceiver.

**Warning: Do use use the Poor Man's CAN Bus in a real project where you
tranmit data over a long distance. Use it only for learning about CAN.**
Seriously, buy a CAN transceiver breakout board.
